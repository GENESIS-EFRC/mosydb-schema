====================
Documentation of Schema for Material Synthesis
====================
A goal put forth by the Materials Genome is to establish large scale data sharing within the materials research
community to facilitate more rapid development of novel materials.
The schema presented here is a first draft for storing synthesis recipes in a structured manner.
We invite feedback on the schema, and ideas for modifying and adjusting it to best suit the needs of the
research community.

This repository contains the formal schemas and some Python scripts for validating the documents.
