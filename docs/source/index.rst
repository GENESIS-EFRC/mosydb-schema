MOSY Documentation
====================
There is a goal put forth by the Materials Genome for large scale data sharing within the
materials research community to fascillate more rapid develop of novel materials.
The schema presented here is a rough draft for storing synthesis recipes. We invite feedback
and collaboration to modify and adjust the schema to best suit the needs of the research community.

This repository contains the formal schemas for MOSY and some Python scripts for validating the documents.
